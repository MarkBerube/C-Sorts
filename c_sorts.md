# C Sorts

A few different sort functions written in C.

## Installation

Clone this repository in GitHub or download the repository as a zip.

Install the [GNU C Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/download.html) and the standard C libaries.

## Usage

Compile the files using GCC the sort you'd wish to run.

Example(to use QuickSort)

```
gcc -ansi -Wall quicksortMain.c quicksort.c -o quicksort.o
```

This command will save the executable as `quicksort.o`, which just needs to be executed with `./quicksort.o`.
